# How the Database Design Meets the Requirements

## 1. Product Management

The database handles products through the following tables:
- `products`: Stores menu items with name, description, price, and availability
- `categories`: Organizes products into logical groups
- `ingredients`: Maintains a list of all available ingredients
- `product_ingredients`: Maps default ingredients to each product

This structure allows for:
- Creating and managing menu items with detailed information
- Categorizing products for easier navigation
- Managing ingredient inventory
- Defining default ingredients for each product

## 2. Customizable Ingredients During Sale

The ability to add/remove ingredients during the sale process is implemented through:
- `order_item_modifications`: Tracks ingredient modifications for each order item
- `product_ingredients`: Defines which ingredients can be removed from products

This design enables:
- Customers to customize products by adding or removing ingredients
- Tracking price adjustments for ingredient modifications
- Maintaining a history of modifications for each order
- Kitchen staff to see exactly what modifications to make

## 3. Simple Reporting Tools

Reporting capabilities are supported by:
- `daily_sales`: Aggregates sales data by day
- `product_sales`: Tracks which products are selling well
- Core transaction tables (`orders`, `order_items`, etc.) that can be queried for custom reports

Reports that can be generated include:
- Daily/weekly/monthly sales summaries
- Product popularity analysis
- Sales by delivery method
- Revenue by category
- Staff performance metrics

## 4. Role-Based User System

The role-based access control is implemented through:
- `roles`: Defines different user roles with specific permissions
- `users`: Associates each user with a role

This enables:
- Different access levels for various staff positions
- Appropriate restrictions for sensitive operations
- Audit trails for actions taken by users
- Customized views based on role (e.g., kitchen staff see different screens than cashiers)

## 5. Multiple Delivery Methods

Support for different types of delivery is handled through:
- `delivery_methods`: Defines available delivery options (in-store, take away, delivery)
- `orders`: Links each order to a delivery method
- `customers`: Stores delivery information when needed

This structure allows:
- Flexibility in order fulfillment methods
- Different pricing models (e.g., delivery fees)
- Separate workflows based on delivery type
- Appropriate customer information collection based on delivery method

### Payment Processing
